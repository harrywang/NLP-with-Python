Join me your host Robert Randall as we delve into biblical instrumentation and music history to discover.
The sounds behind the words of our savior Yeshua.
Well karev miss bacalhau.
Yeshua Messiah.
It is a beautiful Monday evening here.
"In the Colorado Rockies, I'm your host Robert Randall."
Once again with another show of kadosh.
Akaka.
"Holy worship understand the sounds behind our Master Yeshua, the Messiah Father's Day."
We give you glory as we listen to part two of this reconstruction of the silver liar of the UR of the chaldees father.
We ask that again that we understand this is for an educational benefit for the body of Messiah.
And we thank you for this opportunity father to understand the roots of music.
It's a joyous thing.
This is a very unique area of study and we give you all the praise and glory for this father.
And yeshua's name.
Amen.
"Okay today, we continue with part 2 of Richard umbral who will be playing some of his reconstructed silver liar as well as finishing with some final comments as as to the construction of the theory or the science of the sound behind the strings themselves within pentatonic scales as well as in other reconstructive areas."
So you will really be able to hear music in its purest science in terms of sound and how notation is brought about but this is from one of the most ancient sources probably from the time of Nebuchadnezzar as well here today.
From textual critic Irving Finkel who is a Babylonian scholar a textual scholar much like the Hemi Gordon is with Hebrew texts Irving Finkel is going to be detailing to us some of the cuneiform tablets that discuss the musical systems that took music from a seven note system into a nine notes system.
"And so with that being understood that is going to be at the end of our show today family, man."
"hi, I'd like to do an examination of the string instruments again just as a conclusive packaging of each of them so that you have a better idea of what these instruments are in a more succinct formation because much of the research that I went into had a lot of debate surrounding it and I would like to at least give you a reasonable presentation of what each of these instruments are so that we can end on this topic and move forward with our Woodwind instruments in this hover you how to cut IM Yoona this Hebrew walk of faith."
"We know that one of our staple chapters within scripture is Leviticus 23, which talks about the Moa deem or the feasts of the Lord Feast of yehovah with this in mind."
Let us now turn to Daniel chapter 3.
We need to have an understanding of the one passage that gives ABS almost every single musical instrument within scripture.
Let's read through this together Nebuchadnezzar.
The king made an image of gold whose height was 60 cubits and the breadth of it six cubits.
He set it up in the plain of dura in the province of Bevelle.
"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the deputies and the governor's the judges the treasurers the counselors the And all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image, which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up skipping diverse for then the herald cried aloud to you."
It is commanded peoples Nations and languages that whenever you hear the sound of the horn flute zipper liar hop pipe and all kinds of music that you fall down and worship the golden image that ever knez of the King has set up and whoever doesn't fall down and warships.
Shall the same hour be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
Therefore at that time when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn flute zither liar harp pipe and all kinds of music all the peoples the Nations and the languages fell down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up there for at that time certain castes Dean came near and brought accusation against the hoody.
They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king.
Oh King live forever You O King have made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn flute Z the liar hop pipe and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and whoever doesn't fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
There are certain yehudi whom you have pointed over the Affairs of the province of Bavaria Shadrach Meshach and Abednego these men O King have not regarded you.
"They don't serve your Gods Know worship the golden image, which you have set up."
"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and Abednego, then they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar answered them."
"Is it on purpose Shadrach Meshach and Abednego that you do not serve my God, no worship the golden image, which I have set up."
"Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn flute zither lie, a hot pipe and all kinds of music that you fall down and worship the golden image, which I have made well, but if you don't wash it you shall be cast in the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
And who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered the King Nebuchadnezzar.
"We have no need to answer you in this matter if it be so our God in whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of your hand O King, but if not be it known To You O King that we will not serve your God's nor worship the golden image, which you have set up biblical dramatization set aside."
I do hope that You can appreciate Daniel chapter 3 as being the go to chapter 4 biblical musical instruments as a key reference point.
I'd like to encapsulate all the instruments that we've studied in season 1 of this show thus far of all the string instruments.
We've looked at the kin or which was considered to be a portable liar or a guitar by some Scholars Reckoning was also a instrument that was played with a electoral which is a small bone staff much like an inch guitar pick of the day.
We also looked at the ne Bell and it's brother the Annabelle is or the Annabelle was a harp of moderate size and it was portable.
"It Not only was detailed in its composition by Josephus the historian of the first century, but also was said to have 12 strings while the the Bell is or its name comes from as or hebraic lie the ruins To being the number 10 as having ten strings."
"We also looked at the sub Mecca, which was a large harp."
It was also fixed to a stand some accounts.
"Then we also saw the Santorini which is based off of The Book of Psalms, which is in modern sense a dulcimer of the east and west from Hungary and end country folk here in the west as well as the surprising modern example."
Incarnation of what would probably be considered the grand piano?
Finally there is the katate which was a liar or guitar and it's names that gives it away into the modern incarnation of the guitar.
I'd like to now share with you the resources used in this broadcast.
"Dr. John Steiners the music of the Bible and account of the development of modern musical instruments from ancient types Dennis macaques book the davidic cipher unlocking the Arms at music of the Bible.com egyptologist David Rules book Exodus myth or history as well as the Bible Cantina app, and I must apologize for I did not realize where the Bible Cantina app got its resources from quoting Church fathers."
"Apparently, they pull their quotations from Wikipedia."
And so I will do my utmost to find a better resource in future broadcasts.

Finally.
"We're going to end with our part 2 of Richard dumbbells discussing his reconstructed silver liar, and it's tuna."
Being from Babylonian understanding as well as dr. Irving Finkles understanding of the cuneiform Babylonian tablets and how music was transformed from a seven note system to a nine note system.
"This is a rare treat and a beautiful interview, please enjoy."
The chilling of this instrument will rather more complex matter.
"I have spoken before and so did having Finkel about the cuneiform texts, which is called yuuichi 726 which is a laid Babylonian copy of a much older texts, which was called Nabbit new 32 and never knew that it was a collection of lexical texts and the second 30 second tablet of which is devoted to the naming of musical strings this Tablets mentioned 9 strings and they were labeled first string second string third thin string 4th string created by the god."
Are we look at imbalance in the god of Music fifth string 4th string on the behind third string of the behind second string of the behind and behind stream.
For a long time we wondered what was the reason for this form of numbering the notes and the string of the notes and I came to the following conclusion because Sumerians were highly motivated buyer or symmetrical things.
I'd arrived at the tuning of the instrument would also be done in Symmetry and therefore they would take a central note.
Which is this one and they would tune a fifth from it going up and from the central node.
They were tuna V down.
And then from the fifth and they would cuneiform up.
"And from the uppermost ring, they would join a fourth down then from the central string the wood trim the fourth down and up."
So therefore there were arriving at a system which had to be a dental assistant.
"To complement the any Atomic system, they would have to add notes within this fan and these notes would be and this one which amount to the Triton which the satanic integral in music in need of us called in the Middle Ages Sefa djiboutian was he is BMF is the devil."
Lynn music and of course this this integral is diabolical.
"But anyway, it had to it needs by mathematical necessity to exist in any mode that you can think of but this produces the following scalar, which is what I call the Energon in system because it's a system made of nine minutes."
"Now we have had look, My and we see that indeed it has 11 strength."
So what was gained?
"Well, as you can see this bass string is offset."
"It is not within the trapezoidal shape of the lie, and they thought my conclusion is that this was added a bit later and therefore in order to respect symmetry."
This one was added at the same time.
And we then have elements dreams.
"Why did they not like the the system with seven move the three no aspect of the neck or the 11 the strings system, which is called the hand of God or the triskaidekaphobia 13 strange the because these numbers are not regular numbers and we know from tablets we found in the temple library nebu that the music system is based strictly on regular numbers, excluding 7x been 11 and 13 and therefore the ideal number two."
Until musical scale was a night with system the energetic system.
"Now, I will show you how the killing was done on roughly because of take can things that amount of time now we said we've got the central note is a deal and they will tune V about with this is not just and then a fifth down that's about just then a fourth up."
And then a fourth down from here 1 2 3 4 and from the 5th and 4th and here too.
So we have Which is a tent and in scale then we need to tune the third and this one having the tractor.
"In fact, we are choosing here."
Then we can tune the first strength and the last one a marketing director.
I can also sew.
We have the complete system here of 11 notes that we call a handicap chord.
I believe that the hand Accord was a development from the anatomy system at a time.
"They said they said well, you know, it's nice to be forbidden having 11 strange because the Newport X safe so and why not try with 11 strength, it can largely us stand a bit more and of course which will allow for not more modes to be played with an assistant as in lead with 11 strings we have the first mood to 3 we have which is the mode of F and here mode of G and then but array and the murder of be so effectively 11 strains allows for having four modes with them."
So it's a very interesting instrument that these modes are with seven notes and this tends to indicate that this style of music based on the any Accord was a transition period between the nine Hertz system and the Seven loop system which was adopted effectively and completely not before the Familia me see now going back to the ancient yuning where we have whether the nine knows the fun in this game.
The way to generate the next mode would be to locate the tritone.
Here it is and then to correct this node by tuning it up a semitone higher.
And then we have the following mode.
And so the from the mood of the original mode they were tuned they would correct a note of the Triton in order to generate the next node.
You agree that security 774 which of the training instructions will be all Babylonian the u-87 704 which is your primary manuscript is certainly old Babylonian in date.
We can tell this manuscript which is a well-established matter.
We have the mini other old Babylonian tablets more.
So this is certainly the first half of the second millennium BC.
I think you can take that for granted.
Yes.
"That's great and the the subjects which is called you, et7."
106
The Texaco text lexical decks.
"Yes, that's a different matter that is part of a lexical series and one of the wonderful things about ancient Mesopotamian Scholars is they compiled these dictionaries and lists of words lists of grammatical points list of God names and so forth which are very useful for us and there was one particular series called Dabney to which was in fact probably got underway about the last few centuries of the second millennium."
He may be about 1200 BC something like that.
They started to make lists of Sumerian and akkadian words under the name navneet.
"Ooh, and there are 32 tablets that make up this whole composition."
"And the last one is the one which is most important for music because the scribes who compiled it took the old cimmerian words for the names of the strings on this instrument and translated them into their Babylonian equivalence because the connection Writing is you know, sometimes has covers text in the Sumerian language sometimes in the Babylonian language and you can't tell when you look at the cuneiforms signs which language it is until you read it, but with a dictionary like this you have an example of a scholarly mind who wants to make order out of all sorts of disparate material and in this particular case, they take the old Sumerian string names in order and they give the Babylonian equivalents the two languages in a bilingual list."
Do we have evidence of an earlier Texans humor and only?
"B stands and there is a different fragment which has the same list on it, which judging by the script is older probably from the end of the second millennium BC the big one from Earth and most important."
Let's go tapes was probably written in about the 7th Century BC.
The manuscript itself is what we call neo-babylonian.
So it comes out of the school maybe after the fall of Assyria from the time of Nebuchadnezzar or later where some scholarly and some Scholarly context this text was being recopied again.
"So the manuscript from oil which has come to us, which we've been studying itself was written in the first Millennium, but because of this little fragment we can be sure that the content the actual ideas and the words on it come from a slightly earlier period And this is nothing surprising because the whole emphasis of cuneiform scholarship was to preserve learning from the previous period to preserve it."
You could pass it on to copy it to transmit its and the musical information which we have now from these scattered pieces is part of this program where things were established.
They were understood it was written down and then they were preserved and copied and copied and copied and copied.
So we've been talking about these manuscripts as manuscripts.
"And of course, they are wonderful from the cuneiform missed the point of view as important resources when it actually comes to appraising them in terms of their importance with history of Music they are colossal because what we have uniquely and what has become clear perhaps for the first time quite recently is we have archaeological evidence for the instruments themselves."
We have images of them.
We have graphic representations or from and we also have as it were living texts written by musical Minds about this material.
So it means that a musicologist has the wonderful opportunity to combine an instrument or reconstruction of an instrument and understanding that it's with a text written from that culture which is survive to us where the two can be combined to produce real understanding for the first time of what this music really was like
