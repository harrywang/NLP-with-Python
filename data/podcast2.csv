"Hello, welcome to the first episode of little cabinets."
I'm your host Emily.
You can find me on Ravelry as AKA Millie and on Instagram as AKA Millie 9:07 and thank you for joining me today on this brand new adventure.
"I am coming to you from my well, I guess you could say my time.Cabin, my little cabin."
Thus the name of the podcast and Rural Alaska a little town called Keen Eye and I live on the outskirts of Kenai and I am a longtime Knitter.
"So I have been thinking for a long time a very long time years in fact of recording an audio podcast, and I thought that I would get my self in gear and start."
Art 2020 off right and finally settle down to record an episode.
I already have a vlog I hesitate to call it a podcast.
It is on YouTube.
"It is called Anders Milne it's and honestly, if you would like to go over there and check out the visual of everything that we discuss here on the audio portion."
Feel free to do that.
"Warning I do ramble on a tad bit, but I am told that it can be enjoyable."
So I encourage you to go over there and take and take a look there.
I do try to.
Create show notes.
I am not good at that.
"So mainly my my recording of these episodes will be natural and flowing if you will from my poor little Noggin, so that means that I'm a stutter and say the word and maybe lose my train of thought once in a while, but at the same time, I think that for me personally that works best."
Because I become very anxious when I start writing down my notes for my podcast and I really do not want this endeavor to be an anxious one.
I my word for the year 2020 is intention.
I want to live with intention which means honoring myself and one of the ways that I am going to honor myself is recognizing areas that I'm a struggle in and don't feel comfortable in maybe Oh that's means it's also a place of growth for me.
"But at the moment, I'm just going to recognize that writing show notes is little outside my comfort zone keeping track of my my Works in progress and finish objects on Ravelry is not a strong suit either."
"However, I would really like to get better at that."
That would be great because then I wouldn't be scrambling as I was.
In just a few minutes ago to find out the name of a yarn that I am currently using in one of my wips a little bit more about me then and why I started this podcast I am a great lover of audio podcasts and I've been a Knitter for at least 19 years and I find myself continuously learning about knitting every single day from just my own personal interaction.
Action with whatever it is.
I'm working on to hearing from other people through video podcasts through audio podcasts and through just the interwebs and our daily communication with each other like Instagram even and that's why I listed.
Please go over if you'd like and like me on Instagram.
"It's both my personal account and my podcast account so you will find lots of Melding of the two over there and I do post things occasionally about things that I'm learning about and but mainly I just love learning from other people and one thing that I've noticed over the years is that there was a large influx of audio podcast that soon died out and then there were the Mainstays, you know, and people like down Cellar Studios and now Yarns at Yin, who?"
"ooh, and the tune it lit chicks and Oh, no, Paula Deen's Not Paula Deen."
That's a cook.
But Paul has podcast knitting pipeline.
"Those guys have stayed around and I just you know, and then there's been a huge influx now a video podcasts and I think the reason for that is it's a lot easier to create and post on YouTube."
Then it is to create an audio podcast.
A lot easier to edit edit.
"I'm sure well, I know actually but at the same time it's also visually appealing we like to see what people are knitting on the flip side though."
"I as spend a lot of time without cell service and without any means of internet in both in my little cabin and when I'm traveling from Kenai to Anchorage, which is anywhere from a Two-and-a-half to three hour drive and so I find myself longing for more podcasts."
"He listening podcasts, especially on the subject that I am most adore."
So I finally just decided.
"You know, what I'm going to go ahead and do that."
Now the aim of this podcast is twofold one is to continue my love of crafting through and sharing that love of crafting with anyone out there who so cares to listen on the Flip side I also well at the same time I should say another goal of mine of this podcast is to explore ways of crafting with in a tiny space.
The cabin that I am currently residing in is about 360 square feet and that is a two-story one.
"So it's pretty neat as pretty small on each story if you were to compare R a motor home with a pullout for the kitchen that would be about the size of my downstairs, you know, the the living and dining and kitchen area and then I have a really small cubby / Loft area for my bedroom quarters, and I really love living in this tiny space things."
"Be a challenge, however, because there is not there isn't space for me to spread out."
I can't have a spinning wheel an actual life-size spinning wheel in here and I can't have like set up a painting easel.
"I was thinking the other day of how it would be really wonderful to if I could do a puzzle in my cabin, but there's just no place for me to do that."
I don't even have a space.
Case where I can put up a TV my my partner gave me a little video portable video watching device for Christmas this year.
So now I can watch some movies and stuff.
"But you know, otherwise I'm pretty remote here and I thought and space is limited."
And so I've been contemplating the idea of crafting in the small-scale knitting is very portable.
"So, Love love love that."
And I do I'm gone to continue exploring that but there's other forms of crafting that I would like to explore that might not be as portable such things as hand-stitching Stitch sewing for instance.
I don't even have a space that I could set up my sewing machine and then there's embroidery cross stitching.
I want to continue to explore crocheting.
I've been wondering if there isn't space for me to do diamond art it would require.
Why are a lot of effort to put it out and then put it back?
"But you know, I just want to start exploring these ideas of how we can do that."
"Oh, I forgot and also things like hand-lettering calligraphy Artful drawing like things like mandalas, even though I'm horrible at drawing."
I would really like to start exploring that a bit more and you know journaling being thoughtful about my creative outlets and Endeavors so those and I'd love to hear from you as well.
So if you have any suggestions for things that I might try feel free to email me at the moment.
We just have the one email for my Vlog which is Anders Milne it at gmail.com.
So that's Anders Mill knits at gmail.com and feel free to contact me.
There or on Instagram as AKA Millie 9:07 or on Ravelry is AKA Millie speaking of Ravelry.
We actually have quite a few places on Ravelry that you can get in contact with me.
You can get in contact with me personally added me as a friend or emailing me or private messaging whatever they call it.
"But we also have the anders Milne it's Group, which is not very active."
I'd love to see it more active.
"But at the same time since I have such limited access to the internet, it is rather challenging for me."
And then we have a group that we started that is separate from that which is called the 24 days of cheer.
We started that one because for the third year running we have my friend and I have put together the swap of 24 days of cheering which you search Your stash to make minis for each day of the month and then you can choose whether or not you'd like to receive a big scan on the 25th day or not.
And we have international and domestic and all of that and it got to be such a big thing that we decided to open its own group.
And at the same time we thought to ourselves.
"Well, there's a lot of other things other knit along that we'd like to include in that theme and so that you'll find a lot more activity going on on the 24 days of cheer and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute."
"So you can message me on Ravelry through any of the three of those means the two groups, which are again Anders Milne."
It's and 24 days of cheer or private message me at AKA Millie.
All right.
I thought I would maybe tell you a little bit about myself and feel free again to message me if you have any questions about me.
I am literally an open book.
I have no fear of Of recrimination or judgment from those outside and I'm not one to be a curmudgeon about my privacy if you will.
I'm a sharer and I love that about myself.
I embrace that about myself and I love the fact that when people get to know me or they meet me they know that What they see and hear is what they get.
I have no artifice and no intent to harm others and I hope and I pray that that comes across to all of those that I meet.
So feel free to message me and ask me anything you'd like to know about me.
Well a little bit about me that I was actually born and raised here in Alaska and I left for a few years to further my education.
I received a masters.
"Of clinical counseling from George Fox University and while I was gone, I married and divorced a man from that area and then I moved back home and because I longed to be home and to bring to help the people in my community."
So I came back home and I took about a year.
This was right after my divorce like within a few days of me getting The final divorce papers from the court I moved home and I took about a year to thoughtfully.
Research and investigate.
I guess you could say the different agencies that were available to me or still are available here in Alaska for me to align myself with to be a clinical counselor.
And I ended up choosing to come down to this small town called Kenai.
It's a beautiful place on the Kenai Peninsula and we're right on the bay or ocean if you will.
And it's it's a pretty conservative place and at the same time it's a very welcoming place and I came down and I have our I've known about Keen I have visited it.
"I've camped down here my whole life, but I've never really spent a true amount of time down here and when I came down for my interview for the place that I'm now working."
I just it felt right.
"And so when they offered me the job, I willingly accepted and uprooted my life yet again and moved down to Kenai."
Now.
I have been blessed with a large family who is very loving and supportive and caring and so you'll hear me mention my family quite a few times throughout because they are also very creative and in numerous ways.
So I am now separated from my family.
"Yet again, but this time even more remotely than before because before even before I came back home when I live down in the states in Oregon, I might had a brother that lived there and so I had a built-in support network there and now and then I came home to Alaska to Anchorage."
"And of course, I had all of my my family and friends that I grew up with a new people that I was meeting through my networking."
Young and things like that that I was doing and then I decided to end so I had all that but then I decided to uproot my life and come down to Kenai and here I am for the first time in my life without a true like blood connection.
"If you will support network, I've recently discovered that a few of the people that I knew during my 20s have moved down to the peninsula and So I am excited to reconnect with them."
I actually visited with them a little bit this last weekend.
And so I while I thought for the last couple months that I might be pretty alone down here.
I'm I find that I am not and at the same time and never really felt.
Okay.
Yes.
"I did feel a little lonely, but I never have truly felt alone here in Kenai because the people are so welcoming and embracing."
And for that I am very grateful especially because I also had to leave my boyfriend back in Anchorage.
"And so we are now doing a long-term long not dong term, but well, yeah Wonderman but a long-distance relationship and so I find myself traveling to and from Anchorage as often as I can on the weekends to see him and my family and my beloved does come down here as Didn't as he can as well, I don't know how much I will share about Jeremy or MJ because you know, he's not on the podcast, you know, he has very different interest but he is a large part of my life and he I just felt so blessed to have him come in to my life because you know, I don't know about the rest of you, but I imagine that many of you if not all who have gone through."
A divorced wonder if they will ever find love again.
"and you know, I wondered that and I was so sad at the idea of being alone in a sea of people who had partners and children and their life seems so full and I knew that I could make my life full and other ways and yet at the same time, that's one of the ways that I truly wanted to build my life and build my future was with someone by my side and About seven months after our eight months."
"I think after my divorce, I was blessed to to meet Jeremy and fell desperately in love with a very very good man and that above anything feels like a miracle, you know."
So anyway now I'm getting all gushy on you so So that's a little bit about me and where I'm currently at and how I got to where I'm currently at and now I've just realized that before I talked a bit about the podcast but I didn't tell you the segments that are going to be in the podcast because I'd like to move on to the segments.
So so far.
This is what I've come up with for little cabinets.
What we just experienced was is what I am going to be calling.
Let's have a Cuppa.
So sitting down On having a cup of tea having a little chat getting to know each other catching up those kinds of things what's going on in my world then on the cork board will be I will let you know about things which are currently going on with our group and anybody else that I come to know about any information that I can pass on as upcoming as well.
Then I have on the shelf for finished objects.
"Then the idea behind that being You know, you're my little cabin put it on the Shelf."
It's all done done and dusted I could have got I guess I could have called it done and dusted good and I have it then I have on the couch for Works in progress because I the one piece of furniture that I have for sitting on is a little futon and so that's my one couch and that's where I find myself doing all my knitting at least right now in the wintertime.
I'm already daydreaming about knitting outside and a camp chair with my dog running around the grounds.
"So So on the couch where Works in progress and then finally a time for Higa, I I embrace the idea of Higa which I can explain at a later date for you if you'd like and I have been trying to live my life more in that fashion again, it aligns very well with my word for 2020 which is in tension."
"So I will be sharing with you ways in which I am exploring Higa embracing Higa and living Higa in my in my daily life down here or events that reminisce or koe, no coalesce."
"No, that's not the word either coincide."
Maybe with the idea of Higa.
"Okay, let us move onto the cork board."
So as I mentioned earlier we have some Cited things happening in the group of 24 days of cheer and though these are knit alongs crochet alongs and they so in short KAAL SRC ALS.
"We have the 12 gift knit socks, which is being hosted by Stephanie of The Rusted Stitch or hot pink socks on Etsy."
"Oh, sorry at Sea and Instagram and Ravelry the idea behind the to the 12 gift knit."
Socks is that instead of waiting until the fall too late to Holiday time to start working on gifts for our loved ones.
We start in January with the intention of knitting one gift for them each month.
Now this particular hashtag of 12 gift knit socks is around the idea of knitting a pair of socks each month.
And these can be gifted or kept for yourself.
"Currently, I think maybe the pair that I'm going to discuss with you."
Then I am working on are probably going to be for myself.
"But you know, maybe I'll be generous enough to give it and each month."
"We will be for highlighting a specific designer and there will be incentives to use their patterns or use yarn from their shops and if they have shops, and so this Month Let's see."
We are January Spotlight designer is called Sarah Stevens.
She is the dire behind Graceland wolves or Graceland Yarns.
Maybe this is the name of it and she has many very cute designs and she is very personable and very go outgoing and so we are pleased that she is with us and she she is offering up some goodies at the end of this month.
"And if you'd like to know more about that, you can go over to the 24 days of cheer group and check out our threads around that in addition."
We have 2020 is the year of sweaters.
So we're hosting a cal for that as well.
All sweaters are welcome half-finished barely started or ones that are just a twinkle in your I so personally I have quite a few sweaters on the needles and since I have so many on the needles I decided that next month.
I will provide the the details about each of those sweaters and that will be the focus of my next podcast.
On the Shelf.
"Well, I have at least three finished objects that I would like to highlight today."
The first one are my tinsel mitts by Andrea Maori.
I knit these out of chickadee Fiber Arts DK weight in their Pell arose Finch colorway.
It's a beautiful soft colorway that is pink that Fades into gray and variegated.
Yet the variegation is so gentle and its progression.
It just it's it's a lovely blend and chickadee Fiber Arts.
They their focus around there.
They are inspired.
That's the word.
I'm going to use by the birds of the world for each of their color raised and I have a few of their skins that I plan on using for a future project.
"Project for my beloved MJ and so I'm excited to continue using them I use their DK weight, which was very soft."
And there's so much a joy to have between my fingers as I knit up these mittens.
I knit the medium-size mittens and according to Andrew Maori.
And at first I thought I was going to do the good go the convertible mitts.
So what I did was assign it according to her pattern for the Anger lists portion of the of the Mitten and then I went back and I cast on and seemed in the convertible part.
"However, once I had that done I discovered that the when I had the top portion over my fingers to keep them warm over the tips of my fingers."
I found that it was too short and that I felt really uncomfortable with That and so I got to thinking when I so that was the first Mitten so I just cast on the second Mitten and I'm going along I knit the cuff and I'm doing the thumb gussets gusset and I'm thinking to myself what am I going to do about this?
"Do I want to continue and just knit fingerless mitts, or do I want to rip out the convertible part on the First Mid and reknit that or do I want to do mittens all the way and the gorgeous thing about this pattern that I got from Andrew Maori is that she gives you that option you can do any of those three and so what I decided with on the second Mitten was that I wanted a full full full fledged Mitten if you will, so I went ahead and I knit all the way up and when it came for the if you will Crown the creases or Finger decreases."
I got a little concerned because of the shortness of the convertible portion that I had knit and I knit 2 pattern I followed it directly.
And so what I did was is I added in an extra row between the decreases for the crown turns out I didn't need to do that the mitten.
To be perfectly long without it.
"In fact, it's a little over long now."
"However, I am okay with that if in the future I want to I can rip that back and I finished off the thumb closing that off as well and that fit me perfectly."
"Then I went back to the first Mitten that I hadn't it and I detached the and unraveled the convertible top portion of that Mitten and I unraveled the being for the main fingerless mitts and I joined back in my yarn and knit up the same amount of rows as I did on my first Mitten and follow that all the way through the crown and then I stopped and said, I was finished what that means is that I have one thumb that is topless if you will."
"if I may be so risque to say and the other thumb is enclosed and I could have Chloe ripped backing and finished off the first thumb but what I thought was is that wouldn't it be nice if I could have my one thumb free to do to manage, you know things that you need that that are what do they call it touchable, I guess using my phone and my my My touch screen in my car and things like that and not having to take off my Mitten each time."
I wanted to do that.
"So I thought well, this is an interesting idea."
"So I just left it and you know, it has come in quite handy that thumb does tend to get pretty cold because right now it at night it gets down to at least -20 if not more and during the day we are lucky if it is reaching zero, we're actually having A heat wave today because it is forecasted to get to a whopping eight degrees actually tomorrow and the next day."
I think we're going to get up to 19.
It's going to be great.
I might even finally be able to go out for a walk with my dog.
So those are the tensile Mets.
I've been wearing them non-stop since I finished them and I did block them overnight and the way that I blocked them was just to soak them and lay them out.
I didn't pin them out or anything.
I just laid them out in front of my furniture.
- and just allowed that warm air to fluff up the fibers once again and revive the yarn and so I have been wearing those nonstop since that time as is needed at this time of the year up here in Alaska.
The second object that I have finished is a pair of fingerless mittens for my fella MJ.
I did not use a pattern for this because I guess I just didn't want to I just had an idea in my head of what I wanted and I went with it.
I use the same yarn that I knit him some socks for Christmas with I had thought when I bought the yarn that Feet being so large.
"He wears a size 13 and a half that I would need to skein, 's of this yarn which is online sock yarn."
One of my favorite socks sock yarn to use and it turns so I bought two scans and it turns out that I used maybe half of the yarn on in each skein to knit his his socks possibly.
That could be because the yarn is Sport weight to DK.
I think it leans more towards sport weight even though it is sold as a DK weight yarn.
And because of that somehow or other it just seemed to the socks just seem to magically fly off my fingers and the yarn never seemed to De plena.
Shhhh.
So I and he loved the socks on Christmas morning.
So I decided I wouldn't hit him a pair of fingerless mitts so that he too might be able to have the warmth but also have access to his finger Nimble fingers for whatever he May need so I cast on I do believe I cast on 56 stitches or yes.
"I think it was fifty six stitches and I did a two by two rib for about three and a half inches then switch to stocking net and did my thumb increases and then once I was done with the thumb increases, I knit the palm and all this time."
I'm guessing mind you because Jeremy is not with me and he didn't even know at the The time that I was knitting these for him and so I'm guessing so one of the things that I guessed about is that his palm probably went about took up about the length of like 3/4 of my finger with from from my thumb.
So that's what I did and then I switched yet again to two by two rib.
"No, I I apologize."
I was doing one by one rib for the cuffs and for this portion.
"And I switch to one by one rib, because I wanted the fingerless mitts to reach out past the tips of his fingers so that if he was cold, they could be down there and covering his fingers."
But then if he needed to work on something he could fold the top portion back and have access to his fingers if that if you will and so that's what I did and I guesstimated I was a tad bit off.
"Off because it looks it turns out that if I needed to knit, maybe three more rows and length and it would have been a perfect length as it is just the very tips of his fingers stick out of the fingerless mitts and then I went back and I picked up the thumbs and I did the same thing that I did for the main portion of the Mitten."
"I knit for just a little bit and then I switched to ribbing and knit for an extra long while so yet again, he could fold those."
Back or keep them up so that his fingers could be warm or accessible.
He absolutely loves them and I do have a picture of them.
I don't even think I've put it up on Instagram.
Oh my goodness.
I am falling behind but I will be posting those pictures that picture on Instagram.
He does really enjoy them.
He is he does notice that it is still a bit too cold to be wearing right now in the negative.
"Of temperatures, but he is looking quite forward to wearing them."
Once we reach the teens in the temperatures.
And so that went off with a big hitch the song of the not the song the yarn I used again is online sock yarn.
I use the color wave four three eight eight seven and that is a striping kind of fair.
I lie colorway that Goes that incorporates blue brown and gray both the darker gray and a lighter gray and ended up beautifully.
I used a size u.s. To for the ribbing and a US size 3 for the main portion of the Mets in essence.
What I did was repeat the process that I used for his socks on his hands.
So there you are.
And finally the last thing that I have finished recently is a pair of self-striping socks for myself.
I cannot find the ball band for this.
"However, I do know that the yarn is Earth Yarns in the ungh ich fingering weight and that it is a Superwash wool, which I have Forsworn Superwash wool as of now, so I will not be buying any more but you know if I have it in my stash I may use it."
The colorway is a beautiful goal.
Old brown and varying color varying degrees of shades of those two just striping throughout the sock.
I did use my Tiago size double zeros on this and but I didn't account for that in how many stitches I cast on I only cast on 60 stitches this then made it difficult once I was finished with the first sock.
I Why's the error of my ways as I could I well I could but I struggled to get the sock over my heel.
It was just enough that I knew that I couldn't give these socks to my siblings because I have the thinnest feet.
"I believe of all of us and Ankle has and so I decided I was going to keep these because I thought I'll you know, I can I can work with this and maybe when Block it or soak it and then leave it to block."
It will loosen up a bit which I was right.
So I went ahead and just said c'est la vie and I will knit the same saw the second sock the same way if in the end I thought if I can't wear these then I will find somebody with an even smaller heel and Ankle than myself and give them to give the Sox away to them.
I was pleasantly surprised that I could comfortably wear these.
"When they were all done, I am a size 8 and 1/2 in feet."
And so I knit for that.
I am not one of those people that counts how many rows around Zayn it for the leg and then for the foot of the sock before I do the toe instead.
I just measure I use the if I'm measuring if I'm using the heel flap method then I measure from the flap forward.
If I use the fish lips kiss heel method which I did for these socks.
I measure from where the seam starts on the main portion of my sock - and from there I measure out how many inches I feel is necessary before I start the toe for myself and my sisters including my mother.
I do knit six two six and a quarter inches and then I start my toe.
I decrease one round in it two rounds decrease the next round and knit two.
Rounds until I'm down to about 12 or 14 stitches total and use the Kitchener Stitch to bind off.
So that's about my recipe I use for my leg.
I usually go about six inches for the cuff.
I maybe do it all depends on how I'm feeling.
"I might do the the ribbing for the entire cuff, but most of the time I just do the ribbing for about an inch and a half or so before I get switched to stocking net."
So those are my finished objects on Shelf on the couch today.
I thought I would just go ahead and go through my project bags with you.
"The first thing that I have here is a shawl kit that I got from Jimmy beans wool for the month of December, but that I knew I could not knit during that time as I had too many commitments and so it's their 24 days kit."
"And so I have all the accoutrements that I need all the Rules and everything is included in the kit including Stitch markers scissors and in and the yarn, of course so each day."
I am able if I finish the other day to pull out to the next day's skein of yarn that will be incorporated into the shawl and it away it is a lace shawl.
One of the the first Yarns and I do believe it's going to be the main yarn that I used.
I use let me open up here so I can tell you there is the fiber Speights cumulus yarn.
It's a heavy lace yarn that is part alpaca Parts elk and all cozy and this is very much reminiscent of mohair though.
"They're not claiming that it is a mohair yarn the other Learned that this project uses at this point, which I do believe it's only going to be these two colors."
"I'm not sure otherwise, I don't think I remember recall there being any other yarn but I will find out as the month goes on yarn to is an amazingly squishy spun right round Merino single."
It's a single ply which features beautiful unique colors all died by hand.
That's their description.
"My description is yes, it is very beautiful."
And there are Aquas and blips of brown and rust and yellow and pink and white in there.
And that portion is being used for a lace chart.
"The other the fiber Speights alpaca lace yarn is a gray Steely with a tiny bit of blue overtone to it and I Um, I haven't been very mmm."
What's the word?
I want to use gung-ho about this once I got into the lace portion.
It could be that my brain space at the moment is not allowing for me following along with a lace chart pattern.
I'm not really sure about that.
I'm going to give it another good try this week because I don't know about the finished object.
Don't know what they look like.
I'm not actually going over to the website of Jimmy beans wool to find out what that looks like and maybe that is my problem.
Maybe I should go and find out what the finished object is.
I know it's a shawl.
I know it has lace.
I know it's got color blocking and that's about it.
"So maybe I should go and take a look too just to make sure that this is something that I desire to have I am I was enjoying it when I is just knitting the Garter Stitch with the the lace alpaca, but you know, we shall see nothing against the the spun right round yarn at all."
It's just my brain was just not in the mode for lace knitting.
"As for the rest, they are all socks."
So I might just speed through these one of them.
I have spoken of in my Vlog on under smell knits and that is a pair of socks of my own design that I have been knitting since July for my sister Amy again.
We are the same size pretty much or we can fit the same size socks.
And so I went ahead and cast on my Happy for everybody.
All the women in my family 66 is around using US size 0 Thiago needles and I did do my show this time.
"I did a two by two ribbing for an inch or so before I cast on with the main color way, which is another of Earth Yarns and I don't have the colorway with name with me."
"However, I will Drive it to you."
It is a gradient self-striping.
It's not something that I am very keen on at this point at the at first I was pretty excited about it.
And I'm just like but my sister Amy assures me that she absolutely loves the colors.
And so I knit.
"This is a ghost from a golden e no, no a canary yellow with a sky blue alternating stripe."
Which then greedy eights down the blue turns into a gray and the yellow just softens up and softens up until it turns into a lavender and then it reverses back on itself going from that light to dark for the for the yarn.
So the first sock goes from canary yellow down to a very slight yellow with gray stripe then and I'm knitting these toe up then the second sock starts out.
Out with the blue going up through the yellow and the yellow turns into white and the blue is getting darker.
"Oh wait, I apologize."
The blue is now turning into the lavender and now I have a pure white for the yellow portion.
And so I am knitting these again on US size 0 Thiago needles and I each time the Stripe changes colors.
I knit a garter Ridge or a Purl Purl bump if you will.
To delineate between the two the changing of the guards or the changing of the color stripe and that is the portion that I do not like I think it looks a little clunky but my sister shows me that she likes it.
And so I am going with it other people have also assured me that they think it's pretty cool.
It's just not my style.
"But at the same time, I'm grateful that my sister likes it name is just an experimentation on my part."
And so I'm grateful that I was able to just play around.
"And you know discover some more things that you know are not my style but it's just really fun to just try and different things, you know instead of just the same old stocking that sock and I apologize if you just heard my dog kind of cough there he's sitting beside me the next pair of socks that I am knitting is two at a time."
"It was for my mother and these were cast on the day before her birthday, which is December 28, and these are for her birthday, but I did get her another birthday present because I knew I wasn't going to get it done."
But my mother does love my socks that I knit for her as do all of my siblings.
And so I do like to try and accommodate that and since I'm always having Socks On The Go might as well be knitting for those that I love.
So this is a sport weight.
Happy Feet yarn that my mother picked out this last year and liking it.
And it is a dark blue base with I wouldn't call them Speckles.
"I think it's more of a variegated yarn, but it's short variegation and we've got some hunter green some Maroon purply bits and of course the blue which kind of Fades in and out of the more Navy to light blue and it is very handsome."
So I am on the legs of the sock on this and since I am knitting NG at a sport way I am using size.
"Let me see if I can read this needle here sighs u.s. To I am doing magic loop as I'm doing two at a time and I have cast on 56 stitches yet again for these and these are just coming along quite well, so I'm quite pleased with that."
The yarn is very plump and my mother loves the color way lastly.
and for the theme of this month I have cast on the noise here I have cast on the oh my I do not know.
Let me find it on my phone here folks.
It's loading.
I am doing the little bird nif.
Sorry the little bird Socks by Sarah Stevens and these are a cuff down sock.
"I do love cuff down socks and these are also anklets and I have not knit anklets before and I thought you know, what would like to give that a try?"
So that's what we are doing.
I am knitting these out of mom dim sock yarn.
The colorway is 2:07.
It is the makeup of this is me see here 100% purchased Portuguese wool.
It's got three hundred and eighty five meters or three 421 yards and I've knit socks out of these.
"In fact, my sister's birthday socks was knit out of this yarn to and it's very sturdy and lovely and I have no worries that it doesn't have any polymide or nylon in it."
I do think that it's sturdy enough that it it does not need that and I am knitting these on a size zero knit Pros.
I do believe they are and the colorway is a natural Wool with true Speckles this time not variegation of hot pink teal.
No seafoam blue brown.
That kind of has a Moroni overtone to it.
They are quite stunning.
I am loving this pattern.
I the the written directions on the pattern are a tiny bit clunky.
I do believe it's more the fault of the font not the way that she has written it.
It's I'm just finding the font a little it's the font is just too thin for me to read that makes any sense.
So I have knit the ankle portion of this and I am onto the heel flap.
I intend to knit the heel flap tonight and just keep plugging away at these and these ones are the ones that I am not sure they might be for me or they might be for somebody else.
It all depends on how I feel when we are done.
So that is on the couch.
a time for Higa this last week.
I had many opportunities for Higa and I'll start with a wonderful evening.
I spent with my beloved and my a pair of friends that I have down here in Kenai.
We had a scrumptious Meal made by my friends partner and he made it vegetarian to honor my partner my beloved because he is a vegetarian And then we and it was just wonderfully delicious there was avocados and quinoa and beans and red flakes and tomatoes and it was just delicious.
It was lovely afterwards.
We played some games and we just sat for hours around their kitchen table laughing sharing stories and antidotes what one point one of the games were playing.
Required us to only speak in a accent and so all of us are horrible at accents accept my beloved.
He's very good at them.
I think and so my friends partner he did he refuse to even speak at that point.
"So he kept on getting penalized for that during the game, but we were just laughing so hard and it was so enjoyable to come closer together on a freezing cold night and just have Earth's around us then yesterday."
I had gone to Anchorage on Friday night in my beloved and I were able to spend a evening together just cuddling and talking.
"Honestly, we were kind of gushing about just how much we loved each other and thinking about our future and those things and on Saturday."
I was able to join my family and much of my longtime.
Time friends and acquaintances as we bid farewell to my mother's best friend at her funeral and it was a beautiful funeral her children are so dear to me.
We all grew up together and it was heartwarming heart touching and just so and one instance it was sad and in the next instance it was uplifting and hopeful if you will.
"after the services, I guess you will we all hung around and reminisced about my mom's friend and I met up with a bunch of people that I haven't seen in many a year and that's when I discovered that I had a few acquaintances or old friends that actually have moved to Kenai and so we've made plans to meet up and I'm really excited about that then after that my beloved and I I had a lunch together and then we went over and met up with my family for a get-together and my nieces."
"Oh, I had Port purchased a new puzzle for us to work on with my nieces and so my nieces and I set to with that and it was so enjoyable."
We spent hours poring over this puzzle and I just love the quality time that I spend with.
My niece's as we work on different crafting.
"Checks, and I don't know if these are crafting projects if well, we do crafts together."
My niece's are all very crafty painting knitting designing making toys like they're just amazing.
But I really enjoy the time that we spend pouring over puzzles.
It's a team-building thing.
It's a brainteaser.
It's it's exciting when the way we cheer each other on when we make a peaceful.
"It's in the puzzle, you know, and it's just really wonderful and my fella was able to join in there."
"He just really enjoyed pouring over the different pieces and saying oh, well, here's a peach one."
Here's an edge piece.
Here's a polka-dotted one and just handing us the different things that we might need.
"It was just really fun straight from that my fella and I raced over to his friends house longtime friends house for his birthday party and which We spent another four hours enjoying Higa eating pizza delicious pizza laughing playing games just being silly and again reminiscing and sharing stories and yet again, this is all during a time where outside the temperatures have dipped below zero."
Everyone is cold.
But yet you feel so warm inside surrounded not only by the warmth of the home.
"I itself but of the love and laughter that is around you and that's Higa to be warm inside with you know, and it's stay in the the camaraderie and the friendship and the love staves off the freezing cold that may be happening outside your windows and doors."
That's Higa connecting and just building memories.
That's one way.
"a of honoring yourself and honoring Higa Well, that's our show for today folks."
I am so grateful that you were able to join me for my very first episode.
I can't wait to continue exploring these ideas that I've presented to you.
And if you remember next episode is going to be focused on the many many sweaters that I currently have on the needles for the year of sweaters 2020 and I will continue to explore the Idea of intention with you at that time and ongoing throughout the year and I will share my goals with you about that.
"And as I say on Anders Milne, it's everytime."
I close out a show remember to knit what you love and love what you knit.
Take care now until next time.
